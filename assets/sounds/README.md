# Sound Effects Folder

**PLACEHOLDER**

This folder should contain retro sound effects:

Sound files needed:
- pokeball-throw.mp3 - When attempting to catch
- catch-success.mp3 - When Pokemon is caught
- catch-fail.mp3 - When Pokemon breaks free
- encounter.mp3 - When new Pokemon appears
- button-click.mp3 - UI button press sound

Notes:
- Use 8-bit/chiptune style sounds for SNES aesthetic
- Keep files small (under 50KB each)
- MP3 or OGG format
- Low volume, around -6dB to -3dB
